# AWS Lambda Sample using SAM, TypeScript and openapi-generator

In this litle study I generated an alternative to the study of Marcos Godinho, using SAM, TypeScript and Openapi-generator.

## Objectives

1. To use AWS SAM instead of Serveless Framework. The reasons are:
    - Apenas CloudFormation como um script para implantar;
    - Totally free;
    - Like Serverless, it allows local environment for testing quickly.
    
2. To use TypeScript as a development language because it is a techonology already used by the team and enable errors identification more quickly

3.
